FOLDER INFORMATION:
 1. Documentation Folder : • This folder contains the main documentation/Web based presentation modules and index page. This is the way I will be making
			     the presentation instead of the ppt version.
			     It also contains the code (explained below), Data and this README file.

			   • To be able to view the web based presentation copy the whole submission folder into a certain folder. Go to documentation 
		             folder and open "index.html" using a web-browser preferrably Google Chrome.

NOTE: If IE doesn't work well for "index.html" kindly switch to Google Chrome 

 2.  Code    		:  • Refer to data_quality_analysis.py for the data quality analysis python code
			   • Refer to data_analysis.py for the comparative visualization charts generating code.

HOW TO OPEN THE WEB BASED PRESENTATION

The whole data has been documented into a structured website format/style approach. This web based format will be used to make the presentation instead
of a powerpoint presentation.

To open the web page view, open "index.html" in a web browser preferrably Google Chrome. After that it should be quite self explanatory. For all to work,
the directory structures must be respected and maintained.
